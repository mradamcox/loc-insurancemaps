  <h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>
  <p>
  Use this interface to create the <strong>ground control points</strong> that will be used to georeference this document. creating a ground control point requires two clicks&mdash;once in the left panel and once in the right. This records a linkage between a spot on the original map document and the real-world latitude/longitude coordinates for that location.

      <figcaption style="font-style:italic; font-size:.85em;">Once 3 control points are present, a semi-transparent preview will appear.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
  In the example image above, 3 control points have been made using street intersections. You can make as many control points as you want (the more the better!) but often 3-6 are enough. If 3 or more are present, a semi-transparent live preview will be added to the right panel. Use the <code>w</code> key to toggle preview transparency.
  </p>
  <h4><strong>Using the Interface</strong></h4>
  <p><em>Before starting, it can be helpful to pan and zoom around to become familiar with the document and the area.</em></p>
  <p>Creating a control point:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Start a control point by clicking on the map document (left).</li>
      <li>Finish it by clicking on corresponding location in the web map (right).</li>
      <li>You can pan and zoom in both panels during this process.</li>
      <li>You can add a note to a control point. This is helpful if you are not 100% confident in your placement, or just want to point something out to future users.</li>
      <li>You can modify a control point at any time by clicking and dragging it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Deleting a control point:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Select an existing control point via the list in the bottom left, or by clicking on it in the panels.</li>
    <li>Click <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> or type <code>d</code> to delete.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Saving Control Points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can only save the control points once you have 3 or more.</li>
    <li>Click <code>Save Control Points</code> when you are satisfied. This will start the warping process, which may take a few minutes to complete. You will be redirected back to the Document detail page in the meantime.</li>
    <li>Click <i class="fa fa-refresh"></i> to reset the interface. This will remove all changes you have made.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Editing existing control points:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>If someone else has already georeferenced this document, feel free to modify their control points (or add more), to improve the georeferencing&mdash;this is meant to be an iterative process.</li>
      <li>Click <i class="fa fa-refresh"></i> to discard your changes and restore the original control points.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Managing layers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can change the opacity of the preview layer by typing <code>w</code>.</li>
    <li>You can switch to an aerial imagery basemap with the <code>Basemap</code> dropdown menu.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Managing the panels:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can increase the size of the left or right panel with the menu in the top left.</li>
    <li>Checking the <code>autosize</code> box will cause the panels sizes to dynamically update based on whether your next click should be in the left or right panel.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Transformations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is recommended that you use the default transformation, <code>Polynomial</code>.</li>
    <li>Switching to <code>Thin Plate Spline</code> will allow the image to distort and warp to fit all control points exactly, which <em>could</em> be necessary in rare circumstances.</li>
    <li>You can read more about GDAL transformation algorithms in the <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.html#available-transformation-algorithms" target="_blank">QGIS documentation <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> (note: we are only using the Polynomial 1 transformation here).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prioritize finding control points that are widely spread across the map.</li>
    <li>Look for locations that have changed the least over time. For example, the center of street interections, railroad crossings, or, in some cases, the corners or centers of old buildings.</li>
    <li>Locations to avoid using are the edges of city blocks, sidewalks, or street intersections of which you can only see a portion.</li>
    <li>Historical maps may have mistakes, or street names may have changed over time.</li>
  </ul>
