## Preface

Thanks for visiting the Louisiana Maps Georeferencing Commons (LaMGC), currently hosted at [oldinsurancemaps.net](https://oldinsurancemaps.net). This platform is the basis of my MS Geography thesis at Louisiana State University, which aims to provide a new take on public engagement with digital archives through crowdsource georeferencing. See the [about page](/about) for more information.

## Introduction

This project aims to:

- Be a platform for collaborative map georeferencing
- Provide open access to existing online map archives

Not a georeferencing platform *per se*, but a community archive based on Library of Congress materials with georeferencing capabilities.
