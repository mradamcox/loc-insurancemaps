## Volumes

We have chosen **volume** as the highest level of grouping of historical maps in this project. Each volume has one or more sheets that become **[Documents](#documents)** when they are loaded into the project.

When the Sanborn company originally published their maps, the entire coverage of a given city in a given year was released in a single volume. However, in large cities like New Orleans one published edition may comprise multiple volumes, and in the Library of Congress collection, each of these volumes is stored as a separate item. Thus, we use the term "volume" even though it is *almost always* synonymous with "edition," because it more closely reflects the structure of the collection from which this project is built.

=== "Q: What does volume started/not started mean?"
	Users can author their own Web Maps, and add whichever layers they want to them. This is most obviously useful for aggregating all of the layers for a single city in a single year, but you could also combine layers from different years.

=== "Answer"
	If you are signed in you can "start" a volume by loading its sheets. Once at least one sheet has loaded, you can begin transforming them to geospatial Layers through the
    georeferencing process.


- What does volume started/not started mean?
    
    If you are signed in you can "start" a volume by loading its sheets. Once at least one sheet has loaded, you can begin transforming them to geospatial Layers through the
    georeferencing process.
    
- Why isn't my city listed?
    
    Unfortunately, if a city does not appear in the list, that means there is no item in the collection for it. However, do check for old names of your city, or the names of adjacent communinities that may have combined with yours over the years.
    
- Why are some volumes in the list grayed out?
    
    This means the volume exists in the Library of Congress collection, but is not
    available in this projectâ€”because while providing wide geographic and temporal coverage throughout Louisiana is important to us, so is manageable disk space.
    
    We devised the following criteria to determine what volumes to include:
    
    - Include the earliest edition for every community, regardless of date.
    - Due to the disproportionate size of New Orleans, *only* include the earliest edition (1885, which is in two volumes).
    - For all other communities, exclude editions published after 1910.
    
    These criteria produce 266 volumes covering 138 communities, containing 1499 sheets.
