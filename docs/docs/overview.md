# Introduction

## What is this all about?

One of the best ways to engage with historical maps is to visually compare them against other maps, like current satellite imagery. Doing so requires the old maps to be *georeferenced*, a process that embeds latitude and longitude coordinates in the image and allows it to be overlaid directly on other spatial layers.

The web map above shows Alexandria, Louisiana in 1900. Feel free to zoom in and out and explore the old city. By using the tools this site provides, you can create a similar web map for almost any community in Louisiana.

The purpose of this project is to facilitate engagement with historical materials, while transforming them into a standarized geospatial formats. The maps used in the project are from the Library of Congress [Sanborn Maps Collection](https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/about-this-collection/), which contains historical fire insurance maps covering over 10,000 U.S. communities. This project is focused on Louisiana, but this is more a thematic choice than a technical limitation.

## Why historical fire insurance maps?

The Sanborn Map Company surveyed and mapped American cities from the late 1860's through the 1950's, creating city atlases and selling them to insurance companies on a subscription basis. The extensive details they recorded for each building&mdash;commercial use, construction materials, exact locations of heat sources, to name but a few&mdash;provided insurance companies with the information they needed to geographically visualize and balance their risk.

Map production had begun to wind down in the 1950s, but the collection was already recognized for its usefulness far beyond its original purpose. In all, the company mapped over 12,000 American communities, generally returning to each one every 5-7 years to create a full update. The result is an unparalled historical record of urban development in the U.S., and a historical archive with much potential.

In recent years, the advancement of geospatial and web technology has provided new ways to re-engage with these maps. For example, some companies sell access to their own georeferenced mosaics of the maps ([EDR](https://edrnet.com/introducing-sanborn-viewer/), [ERIS](https://www.erisinfo.com/eris-xplorer/), [FIMo](http://www.historicalinfo.com/fimo/)), some cities have free viewers ([Boston](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org), [Bozeman](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f4cf486b4d7f4988aa589e7dd989f5e9), [Milwaukee](http://webgis.uwm.edu/agsl/sanborn/)), and digital history projects use georeferenced maps as foundational materials ([Reconstructing Bloomington](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f38fd8915aa14f4e99b96455dcdad49e), [What the Tulsa Race Massacre Destroyed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/24/us/tulsa-race-massacre.html), [Homestead Hebrew Maps](https://maps.homesteadhebrews.com/)).
