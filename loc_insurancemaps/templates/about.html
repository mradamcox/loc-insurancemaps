<p>The base of this platform is <a href="https://geonode.org">GeoNode</a>, an open source geospatial content management system.</p>
<p>Two distinct custom components have been added:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An interface and database configuration tailored specifically to the structure of this map series.</li>
  <li>A suite of tools that allows users to split, trim, and georeference the maps.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Included Volumes</h2>
<p>
  To facilitate wide geographic and temporal coverages throughout Louisiana, while
  also limiting the overall number of volumes to make disk space manageable, the
  following criteria are applied to determine which volumes to include from the
  Library of Congress.  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The earliest available edition for every community, regardless of date.</li>
  <li>For New Orleans, <em>only</em> the earliest edition (1885).</li>
  <li>For all other communities, all editions published through 1910.</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters result in an overall total of _______</p>
