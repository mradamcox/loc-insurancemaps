    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This platform allows anyone who is interested to import and georeference scanned maps of from the <a href="https://loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps">Sanborn Maps Collection</a> at the Library of Congress. Georeferenced layers can be trimmed and aggregated within public web maps to build seamless mosaics of historical Louisiana communities. This project is the basis of a M.S. Geography thesis at Louisiana State University.
    </p>
    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Study Period</strong> - February/March, 2022<br>
      This stage will see the heaviest use of the site, and users will be sent an optional survey near the end of March.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Transfer</strong> - April/May, 2022<br>
      At this point, single GeoTIFF files will be generated from the mosaics, and transferred to <a href="https://atlas.ga.lsu.edu">LSU Atlas</a> where they will be published for for long-term public use.
