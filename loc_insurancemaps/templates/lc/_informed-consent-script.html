	<dd>"Creating a Public Space for Georeferencing Historical Fire Insurance Maps"
    <dt>Purpose and Procedures of the Study</dt>
    <dd>Members of the public are invited to engage with historical map archives by participating in a crowdsourcing project. Registered members can access old fire insurance maps of Louisiana communities and use tools on this site to transform the files into interactive web maps. For the duration of the study period, general usage statistics will be collected to better understand user engagement. At the end of the study period a brief, optional, survey will be distributed via e-mail to participants in order to learn about their experience and reasons for participating in the project.<br><em>Members of the public who do not wish to participate can still view, download, and explore any content on this site.</em>
